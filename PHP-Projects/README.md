Free PHP Projects
=================
<p>Though I am a hardcore Java/JEE developer, i also love doing coding in PHP, Ruby. I started coding PHP around 2004, later create my own PHP MVC framework like Apache Struts which i use to create student/academic projects.</p>

<p>Later i decided not to reinvent the weels and started using Cake, CodeIgniter MVC frameworks but the framework which really take my heart is Larevel 4.</p>

<p>Following are the list of all my PHP projects which can be particularly helpfull to Students / Job Seekers or those who want to learn PHP by making a simple project. I have 100's of projects developed in PHP and will upload one-by-one (whenever i get time), so stay tuned.
