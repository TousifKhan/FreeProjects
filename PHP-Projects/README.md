Free PHP Projects
=================
<p>Though I am a hardcore Java/JEE developer, i also love doing coding in PHP, Ruby. I stared coding PHP aroung 2004, later create my own PHP MVC framework like Apache Struts which i use to create student/academic projects.</p>

<p>Later i decided not to reinvent the weels ans started using Cake, CodeIgniter MVC frameworks.</p>
